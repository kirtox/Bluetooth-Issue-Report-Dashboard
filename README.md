# Bluetooth Issue Report Dashboard

A dashboard for collecting, visualizing, and reporting Bluetooth issue data.  
The project provides both backend and frontend components, supports containerized deployment, and is designed to streamline Bluetooth testing and debugging workflows.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Issue Tracking & Logging**  
  Store and organize Bluetooth-related test results and logs.

- **Manage logs**  
  Once the logs are updated to the database, we can manage the log in this dashboard. 

- **Data Visualization**  
  Frontend dashboards to plot **Bluetooth Driver Reliability**, **Integration Test**, **Platform Summary**, **WLAN Reliability**, and other metrices.

- **Excel & Report Export**  
  Generate structured reports for further analysis or sharing.

- **Containerized Deployment**  
  Podman Compose files are included for running services consistently across environments.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kirtox/Bluetooth-Issue-Report-Dashboard.git
cd Bluetooth-Issue-Report-Dashboard
```

### 2. Podman Compose Commands by PowerShell
For development:
```bash
# Run in PowerShell window
podman-compose -p btird_dev -f podman-compose.dev.yml up --build

# Stop
podman-compose -p btird_dev -f podman-compose.dev.yml down
```

For production:
```bash
# Run in background
podman-compose -p btird_prod -f podman-compose.prod.yml up --build -d

# Stop
podman-compose -p btird_prod -f podman-compose.prod.yml down
```

For checking current status of each podman container:
```bash
podman ps
```

### 3. Production Environment Setup

In production, make sure to configure firewall rules and port forwarding:  

#### 🔥 Firewall
Allow inbound traffic on ports **8001** and **5174**.  

#### 🔀 Port Proxy (Windows)
Run the following commands in an **PowerShell / CMD**:

```bash
# Establish NAT
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=myIP listenport=5174 connectaddress=127.0.0.1 connectport=5174
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=myIP listenport=8001 connectaddress=127.0.0.1 connectport=8001

# Check NAT table
netsh interface portproxy show all
```

This allows external devices on your LAN to access the dashboard services through the host machine.
